# Surco Creative Studio

## Purpose

This site was built as the official digital home of Surco, a creative studio focused on design, development, and storytelling. Founded with the help of my family in 2025, this project became an opportunity for me to grow my coding and problem-solving skills while creating something visually engaging.

Surco was created to support underrepresented voices, local entrepreneurs, and emerging brandsâ€”offering them a space to grow and expand their vision through thoughtful design and technology.

## Future Sections (To Add)

- **Live Site URL**: [https://surco.studio](https://surco.studio)
- **Project Goals and Outcomes**: This site aims to connect Surco with businesses that need help growing through visual identity, strategy, and creative storytelling. I want to add a beginning section to transition into the about us section and then finish socials so that we can link them.
- **Features Overview**: Smooth-scrolling navigation that highlights the current section, interactive pricing packages with hover and click effects, and sticky visuals that enhance the storytelling of each section.
